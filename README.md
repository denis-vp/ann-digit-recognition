This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network designed from scratch for recognizing handwritten
digits. The neural network is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for image classification
tasks.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to provide a clear and simple implementation of a neural network for recognizing
handwritten digits. By using Python and basic numerical libraries, we aim to demonstrate the fundamental concepts behind
neural networks and how they can be applied to real-world tasks like image recognition.

## Features

- Implementation of a feedforward neural network architecture.
- Training over the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy metrics.
- Python code designed for readability and easy understanding.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/neural-network-handwritten-digit-recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd neural-network-handwritten-digit-recognition
    ```

3. Install required dependencies (if any).

4. Run the main script to train and evaluate the neural network:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

5. View the results and explore the code to understand the implementation details.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- Pygame
